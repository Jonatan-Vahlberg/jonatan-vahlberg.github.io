            <div class="inside inStory">
                <p>Madeline and her parents were moving towards the safezone south of they're house as did all the other pepole of the they're samll town. 
                   Both of her parents had they're hands full of clothes and necessities  while Madeline had a small backpack and trailing  behind her a small wagon
                   filled with cat food and ofcourse her three kittens in they're collective cage. <br></p>

                <p>As they neared the safezone the road was packed with people and at the end of the road a steel fence, fencing of the safezone and behind the fence 
                    the military run camp. But as Madeline took a few more steps she noticed that the wagon she had been dragging felt lighter. As she turned around 
                    the cage was open. First the panic set in but then after almost starting to cry, she had made a comittment to her parents to take care of the cats,
                    standing still for a moment she turned and ran home hoping despratly that her kittens had returned to their house. But as Madeline reached her living room
                    no cat could be found. Madeline turned prepared to leave, braving the undead masses that had started gathering outside.</p>

            <button class="input about">ABOUT THE GAME</button>
            <div class="inside inAbout">
                <p>The purpose of this game is for Madeline to collect her three kittens while avoiding zombies. In style with classic adventure games you can move in 
                    four cardinal directions: Up/North Down/South Right/East Left/West. The game takes place in a remote mountain town and features 10+ diffrent scenes 
                    all with original art assets. Inorder to collect the cats you have two primary items to use a green zombie radar and a yellow cat radar the zombie 
                    radar tells you if a zombie is within a certain proximity to the player while all zombies moves after the player the cats remain statonary. As you 
                    collect a cat another zombie gets up and starts walking towards you the game gets progressvly harder. To the south of the starting point is a safezone 
                    which is the goal for the game get all the cats and bring Madeline to the safezone, sound simple right?...Well good luck.</p>
